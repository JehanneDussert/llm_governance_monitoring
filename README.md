# From metrics to governance

**Production-grade LLM observability stack: sovereign, GDPR-compliant, open source.**

Monitor, trace, evaluate and compare open-source language models in production. No data leaves your infrastructure. Built for organizations that need AI governance by design.

---

## Why this exists

Most LLM tooling assumes you're using OpenAI and don't care where your data goes. This stack is built for the opposite constraint: local models, full data sovereignty, and observability derived directly from production metrics, not synthetic benchmarks.

The evaluation layer goes one step further: a configurable local evaluator assesses each response against the criteria you define (GDPR compliance, bias detection, AI Act compliance, cognitive load, digital minimalism) and automatically routes traffic to the best-performing model for each task **based on YOUR internal governance criteria**.

Three independent FastAPI microservices share a `back/shared/` layer (Pydantic schemas + config) and communicate via HTTP sync and Redis pub/sub.

## Quickstart

**Prerequisites:** Docker, docker compose.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JehanneDussert/llm_governance_monitoring
cd llm_governance_monitoring

cp .env.example .env
# Fill in Langfuse keys

docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml up -d

make pull-models  # downloads qwen2.5:1.5b, gemma3:1b, llama3.2:3b, deepseek-r1:1.5b
```

If necessary, additional models can be replaced (just remember to configure them in your litellm configuration as well).

## Configurable judge

The evaluation layer runs a local LLM-as-judge after each response. Criteria, weights, use cases and routing preferences are configurable from the UI.

**Built-in criteria:**

| Criterion | Tags | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Pertinence | quality | ✅ |
| Concision | quality | ✅ |
| Fiabilité factuelle | quality, ai_act | ✅ |
| Équité | ethics, ai_act | ✅ |
| Autonomie utilisateur | ethics, ai_act | ✅ |
| Transparence | ethics, ai_act | — |
| Protection des données | compliance, rgpd, ai_act | — |
| Accessibilité | inclusion, rgaa | — |
| Injection de prompt | security, anssi, owasp_llm01 | ✅ |
| Fuite de données | security, anssi, owasp_llm02 | ✅ |
| Refus éthique | security, ethics, anssi | ✅ |

Criteria are tagged by domain (`quality`, `ethics`, `compliance`, `security`, `ai_act`, `rgpd`, `anssi`…) making it easy to activate a full compliance profile in one click. Custom criteria can be added from the Settings view.

Custom criteria can be added from the settings view.

**Use cases:** general, summary, translation, code, administrative writing, analysis. Add your custom ones!

The judge model (default: `ollama/gemma3:1b`) runs locally.

---

## A/B Testing

Send traffic to two models, then compare:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8003/ab/results
```

```json
{
  "model_a": { "model": "ollama/qwen2.5:1.5b", "sample_size": 12, "avg_latency_ms": 4.2, "avg_eval_score": 0.81 },
  "model_b": { "model": "ollama/llama3.2:3b",  "sample_size": 9,  "avg_latency_ms": 8.7, "avg_eval_score": 0.76 },
  "winner": "ollama/qwen2.5:1.5b"
}
```

Winner is determined by eval score when available (local judge), latency otherwise.

---

## use_case × model matrix

Scores accumulate per use case in Redis. The matrix view shows which model performs best per task:

```
              qwen2.5:1.5b   llama3.2:3b
Summary           0.84           0.71
Translation        0.79           0.88
Code               0.72           0.85
Admin writing      0.88           0.74
```

→ Route translation and code to llama3.2, summary and admin writing to qwen2.5.

---

## Key design decisions

**Local evaluation judge:** quality scoring runs on Ollama. Sovereign and usable in air-gapped or regulated environments.

**Governance from metrics:** the observability layer translates raw Prometheus metrics into structured governance signals. Dashboards are provisioned automatically via Grafana.

**Judge traces filtered:** evaluation calls to LiteLLM are excluded from the traces view so only user interactions appear.

**pip in Docker, uv locally:** uv for fast local dev iteration, plain pip in containers for deterministic builds.

**Shared schema layer:** all three microservices share `back/shared/src/shared/` for Pydantic schemas and config, ensuring type consistency across service boundaries.
